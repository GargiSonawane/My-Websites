    <h1>About my art</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p> I love to draw. When I draw, I am at peace. The way how the pen moves and draws and how color pencils color in shapes keeps me relaxed. I try to draw as much as I can. I usually draw people, But sometimes I draw other things. My drawing style is anime, a style usually used in animation. I draw in my sketch book, But sometimes I paint things. I use sharpies, color pencils, and mechanical pencils. To paint, I use pencils, acryilic paint, and brushes of different styles. Anni Albers once said, "Art is something that makes you breathe with a different kind of happiness".</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My Inspiration is comic books. Comic books give me ideas on drawing and help me come up with ideas for characters. It is also something I read when I'm tired of drawing. Comic books also give me ideas for storylines (Don't worry, I don't copy). They give me ideas for new things for my stories. Comic books are the perfect blend of art and literature. This why it's my inspiration. Click on the image below to learn more on comic books!</p>

        <p>This is a redraw of an old drawing I made. Her dress looked pretty gothic so she is the gothic furry</p>

        <p>One of my OC's, Rudy the forest pixie was originally not going to have wings but I thought she'd look better in them, so she became a pixie.</p>

        <p>Sailor Moon was the first anime I ever knew. So to commemorate that, I drew her!</p>

        <p>I saw a stylised circus baby concept on reddit, so I thought it would be fun to draw. I apologise for the fact that it is not fully colored.</p>
