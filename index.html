    <h1>About my art</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p> I love to draw. When I draw, I am at peace. The way how the pen moves and draws and how color pencils color in shapes keeps me relaxed. I try to draw as much as I can. I usually draw people, But sometimes I draw other things. My drawing style is anime, a style usually used in animation. I draw in my sketch book, But sometimes I paint things. I use sharpies, color pencils, and mechanical pencils. To paint, I use pencils, acryilic paint, and brushes of different styles. Anni Albers once said, "Art is something that makes you breathe with a different kind of happiness".</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My Inspiration is comic books. Comic books give me ideas on drawing and help me come up with ideas for characters. It is also something I read when I'm tired of drawing. Comic books also give me ideas for storylines (Don't worry, I don't copy). They give me ideas for new things for my stories. Comic books are the perfect blend of art and literature. This why it's my inspiration. </p>

        <p>This is a redraw of an old drawing I made. Her dress looked pretty gothic so she is the gothic furry</p>

        <p>One of my OC's, Rudy the forest pixie was originally not going to have wings but I thought she'd look better in them, so she became a pixie.</p>

        <p>Just a little sailor girl I drew when I was bored. It turned out to be one of my greatest drawings.</p>

        <img src="sailor%20moon.jpg">
        <p>Sailor Moon was the first anime I ever knew. So to commemorate that, I drew her!</p>

        <img src="stylised%20circus%20baby%20concept.jpg">
        <p>I saw a stylised circus baby concept on reddit, so I thought it would be fun to draw. I apologise for the fact that it is not fully colored.</p>
